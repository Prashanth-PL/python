#  What is python?
#  Python is an interpreted, interactive, object oriented programming language.


# Features?
# Easy to learn and use the syntax.
# free and open sources
# object oriented
# huge library standard
# extendable library
# marge with Multiple programming lauguage


#  type casting :- converting one data to another
# implicit type casting  ex: num = 10 ( converts automatically)
#  explicit type casting ex : num = int(10) ( user converts the data type of an object  to require data type)

#  operators :- to perform a specific operation between operands ( a + b  where a and b are operand and + is operators)
#  unary operators
#  binary operators
#  Ternary operators

#  in binary operators

#  Arithmetic operators ( + , - , *, / , %, //, **)
#  Relational or Comparision (< , > , <=, >=, ==, !=)
#  Logical (and, or, not)
# Assignment operators ( a += b, a -= b, a *= c)
# bitwiswe operators
#  Idendtity ( is, is not)
#  membership (in, not in)

# Data types

# Numeric :- int, float, complex
#  boolean 
#  set
#  Dictionary
# Sequence :- String, float, tuple

#  variables :-container which holds single value or single data at a time 

# control statement

#  conditional/decision : if, if-else, if-elif-else, nested if

#  Iterative/ loops : for, while, nested loop

#  jump : break, continue, pass

#  reference count is zero than the object moves to garbage collection

#  Tokens 
# 1. keywords
# 2. Identifiers
# 3. Literals
# 4. string
# 5. numeric
# 6. Tupels

#  Range function: 
# single arguments (syntax: range(stop))
# Two Arguments (syntax: range( start, stop))
# Three arguments ( syntax: range (start, stop, step)) 


# Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC) / Software Testing Life Cycle (STLC)

# 1. Requirement
# 2. Analysis FA, TA 
# 3. Design
# 4. Development BL
# 5. Testing 
# 6. Deployment
